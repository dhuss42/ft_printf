## 1. Project overview

For this project, I set out to reimplement printf(), one of the most commonly used functions in C. The main goal was to handle a variable number of arguments using variadic functions.

My ft_printf() function supports several format specifiers, including:

%c for characters  
%s for strings  
%p for pointers (in hexadecimal format)  
%d and %i for integers  
%u for unsigned integers  
%x and %X for hexadecimal numbers (lowercase and uppercase)  
%% to print a percent sign
